Notable changes to the Moderne platform

### UI v9.7.0

#### More markers!

We have increased the types of markers we annotate and surface in the diff view of the UI. Previously you may have noticed search markers displaying like this:\


<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (2).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

The new markers will now render as squiggly lines with an icon. If there are additional details it will allow you to click in to see those details:\


<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (1).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

In addition to search markers, we will render info/debug, warnings, and errors in a similar way:

![](<../.gitbook/assets/image (10).png>)

![](<../.gitbook/assets/image (4).png>)

![](<../.gitbook/assets/image (16).png>)
