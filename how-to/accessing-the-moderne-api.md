# ðŸš€ Accessing the Moderne API

Moderne.io offers a GraphQL API at https://api.public.moderne.io for customers to interact with through the usage of a personal access token.

Note: Personal access tokens do not retain roles that are granted to your user account. Actions that require roles (deploying recipes and uploading ASTs) will fail as forbidden if attempted with an access token.

{% hint style="info" %}
If you want to write and test GraphQL queries, you can use the graphql icon at the top right of the UI or go directly to [https://public.moderne.io/graphql](https://public.moderne.io/graphql).
