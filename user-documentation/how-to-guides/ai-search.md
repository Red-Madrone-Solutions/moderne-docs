3. Now, when you go to type something in the search bar, you'll use AI search instead of the traditional search.

## How to use AI search effectively

To get the most value out of AI search, you'll want to approach searching for recipes differently than you normally would. Instead of trying to enter an exact recipe name, you might consider:

* **Asking questions** such as, "How can I make my code more secure?"
* **Entering keywords** such as, "JUnit" or "Jakarta".
* **Expressing something you want to do** such as, "I want to upgrade Spring".
