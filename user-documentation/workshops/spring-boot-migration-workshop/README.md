# Spring Boot migration workshop

In this workshop, you'll find a variety of exercises that demonstrate the different ways you can automatically migrate or upgrade an application to Spring Boot 3. The core technology behind each of these exercises is [OpenRewrite](https://github.com/openrewrite/rewrite).

You do not need to complete all of these exercises. Instead, please pick the ones that are more interesting or relevant to your needs.

Regardless of which exercise you pick, you will migrate an old version of the [Spring PetClinic repository](https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-petclinic/) to Spring Boot 3.
