# Quick Start: Running your first recipe

To help orient you to Moderne, let's run a couple of recipes on some open source projects that we have imported into Moderne.

In this guide, we will

* [ ] **Login with GitHub**
* [ ] **Find a recipe to search across multiple repositories**
* [ ] **Examine the results of our recipe**
* [ ] **Narrow our focus and run a recipe to transform a repository based on the search**
* [ ] **Verify the results and issue a Pull Request to transform the code**

## Step 1: Go to [app.moderne.io](https://app.moderne.io) and _login_

## Step 2: Sign in with GitHub

The first time you sign in to Moderne through GitHub, you are presented with an authorization prompt for a few permissions to help enhance your experience.

{% hint style="info" %}
For a better understanding of the permissions requested, please see [GitHub Permissions](../references/github-permissions.md#oauth-permission).
{% endhint %}

## Step 3: Exploring the recipe catalog

Let's start by exploring recipes organized by language. As you navigate down into the catalog, you'll find different topical categories of recipes.

## Step 4: Selecting a recipe

Let's find a good recipe to start from to help illustrate how to search across multiple repositories.

1. Select [_Browse_](https://app.moderne.io/browse) \_\_from the left-hand menu
2. Then select [_Java_](https://app.moderne.io/recipes/org.openrewrite.java) \_\_ from the list of languages
3. Select the [_Cleanup_](https://app.moderne.io/catalog/org.openrewrite.java.cleanup) category
4. Click on [_Common static analysis issues_](https://app.moderne.io/recipes/org.openrewrite.java.cleanup.CommonStaticAnalysis) and then click _More Details_ \_\_ to go to the recipe details

## Step 5: Selecting repositories

To narrow our scope a little bit, from the Recipe details page for _SpringBoot 2.x Best Practices:_

* Click the _Select Repositories_ button
* In the search dropdown field, add an organization filter.
* Use the transfer list buttons to add and remove repositories from your filter.

Now we should see a number in the _Select Repositories_ button indicating how many repositories we to search.

## Step 6: Running a recipe

Click _Dry Run_ to start the recipe.

On the results page, you see a summary of your recipe criteria and an indication of progress.

![](<../.gitbook/assets/image (12).png>)

Each result for a repository shows files searched and changes detected.

Click on either ![](../.gitbook/assets/diff-button.png) button or the name of the repository (e.g. _spring-cloud/spring-cloud-aws_) to view the proposed changes.

## Step 7: Viewing results

The resulting diff allows you to preview the changes from the recipe and then decide what to do.

![](<../.gitbook/assets/image (17).png>)

As an example, the screenshot above illustrates how this recipe converts `@RequestMapping(â€¦)` to the more specific HTTP Verb `@GetMapping(â€¦)`.

## Step 8: Creating a Branch & Pull Request

The next course of action is to commit the changes.

* In the results view, select the repositories you want to commit.
* Click _Commit Selected \_\__. This will open a prompt allowing you to select different actions like committing directly, opening a pull request, etc.

From this prompt, you can customize either the _Branch Name_ or _Commit Message_ to match the contributing guidelines of a particular repository.

{% hint style="info" %}
If you have committer access to the repository, create a branch directly on the project.
{% endhint %}
